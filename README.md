# Attendance_Tracker
 This is a face recognition project using Machine Learning concept OpenCV. This project integrates a camera to track the face and making the attendance in a spreadsheet.
 Attendance maintenance is a significant function in all the institutions to monitor the performance of the employee. Every institute does this in its own way. Some of these institutes use the old paper or file-based systems and some have adopted strategies of automatic attendance using some biometric techniques. 

A facial recognition system is a computerized biometric software that is suited for determining or validating a person by performing comparisons on patterns based on their facial appearances. Face recognition systems have upgraded appreciably in their management over the recent years and this technology is now vastly used for various objectives like security and commercial operations. Face recognition is a powerful field of research that is a computer-based digital technology. Face recognition for the intent of marking attendance is a resourceful application of the attendance system. It is widely used in security systems and it can be compared with other biometrics such as fingerprint or eye iris recognition systems.
